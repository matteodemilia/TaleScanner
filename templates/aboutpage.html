                        <h4>What is Tale Scanner used for?</h4>
                            <p>Tale scanner is developed to help Speech and language pathologists analyze test results in a fast and efficient way.</p>
                        <h4>How is it made?</h4>
                            <p>We utilize spaCy which is a natural language processing python library.
                                <br> What spaCy analyzes is the type-token ratio, morphemes, number of words, unique words, and clauses. 
                                <br>We also utilize a library called “Gramformer”. Gramformer is used to detect verb errors in the user input.</p>
                        <h4>Our goal</h4>
                            <p>Our main goal is to help Speech and language pathologists by limiting time spent analyzing test results.
                                <br>A lot of their time is taken counting the specific statistics in each test</p>
                        <h4>Acknowledgements of anomalies</h4>
                            <p>Tale scanner can only analyze English at the moment.
                                <br> We hope to expand the range of different types of languages users can analyze in the future.
                            <br>Please note that some check boxes take longer to analyze compared to others.</p>

                        <h4>Input page</h4>
                            <p>Simply copy and paste text in the input box. 
                                <br>Next check which boxes you would like to analyze for!</p>
                        <h4>Results page</h4>
                            <p>At the moment our results only count the amount that the user checks in the input page. 
                                <br>It analyzes each sentence one by one.
                            <br> click the "+" to see more details about the chosen analysis, confidence rating and how the analysis got calculated.</p>

                        <h1> How to Read Tale Scanner Results </h1>

                        <p class = "about-text"> about how to read results </p>
                        <h4>How are results determined?</h4>
                        <p> The results are determined by algorithms our team made with the help of "spaCy" and “Gramformer”.  
                        </p>
                        <h4>How is confidence rating determined?</h4>
                        <p>
                            <br>Testing is done to ensure our system is accuratly analyzing the inputted text by the user.
                            <br>  We first test each analysis check box by itself to verify functionaility. 
                            <br> We then pair the check boxes with another. Lastly, we group them together to find out any potential
                            <br>  issues with the analysis. Another important reason is to also check the runtime to warn users of which
                            <br> ones take longer. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Confidence rating per results</h4>
                        <p>
                            Having a high confidence rating means the results have high accuracy with no mistakes. 
                            <br>Those with lower confidence ratings mean there are some errors in the analysis. 
                        </p>
