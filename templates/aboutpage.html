                        <h4>What is Tale Scanner?</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Tale Scanner system is a natural language processor designed with the intention of 
                                providing a consistent alternative to inaccurate generalize artifical intelligence services.
                                Tale Scanner can and should be utilized as a relatvie source for linguistic improvement. 
                                As all measurements of Tale Scanner are algorithmically determined, there may exist exceptions, 
                                anomalies, and unique error cases that have not been identified and/or handled yet. 
                            </p>

                        <h4>Tale Scanner's Goal</h4>
                            <p>
                                The goal of the Tale Scanner system is to provide a consistent, reliable, and informative 
                                tool to conduct analysis and help speech language pathologists assess linguistic capability. By providing an 
                                algorithmic process based on pattern identification, the Tale Scanner system eclipses
                                the consistency of generalized machine learning models, and often the accuracy as well. 
                                <br><br>
                                The user interface of the system is designed with simplicity and intuitiveness in mind. Tale 
                                Scanner notifies the user of time complexity warnings, labels all functionalities, and outlines 
                                further detail in both the results output, and this "About" page.  
                            </p>

                        <h4>Acknowledgement of Anomalies, Paramaters, and Analysis Failures</h4>
                            <p>
                                Tale Scanner was developed by a collegiate team of four during a set time frame. Due to the nature of 
                                development, it is important to note that Tale Scanner is not a perfect analysis tool by any measure; and 
                                due to the nature of linguistic analysis, it never will be. Although some analysis choices may display entirely 
                                accurate results with high consistency, the process will still have errors if such a case were to arise.
                                <br><br>
                                Tale Scanner currently supports:  [ <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #004e8d; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">English</span> ]
                                <br><br>
                                Each analysis choice differs in completion time, in turn, analysis choices that take more than one second in processing time
                                provide warnings to the user when hovering over the respective choice-box.

                        <p class = "about-text"> about how to read results </p>
                        <h4>How are results determined?</h4>
                        <p> The results are determined by algorithms our team made with the help of "spaCy" and “Gramformer”.  
                        </p>
                        <h4>How is confidence rating determined?</h4>
                        <p>
                            <br>Testing is done to ensure our system is accuratly analyzing the inputted text by the user.
                            <br>  We first test each analysis check box by itself to verify functionaility. 
                            <br> We then pair the check boxes with another. Lastly, we group them together to find out any potential
                            <br>  issues with the analysis. Another important reason is to also check the runtime to warn users of which
                            <br> ones take longer. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Confidence rating per results</h4>
                        <p>
                            Having a high confidence rating means the results have high accuracy with no mistakes. 
                            <br>Those with lower confidence ratings mean there are some errors in the analysis. 
                        </p>
